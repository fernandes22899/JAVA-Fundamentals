Beginning Java work. Learning basics such as loops, if-statements, methods, classes, etc.

Everything I've pushed into this repository is from my first college computer science class.
Fundamentals includes: working with input files, output files, learning how loops, if-statements,
methods, classes, and different types of variables worked.
